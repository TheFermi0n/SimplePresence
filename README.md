# SimplePresence-TF

**Note:** *Support for the latest Discord versions is still being worked on and may not be perfect.*

SimplePresence-TF is an Electron app for macOS that allows users to easily set their Discord Rich Presence Status. It is a modified version of the original [SimplePresence](https://github.com/julianschiavo/SimplePresence), tailored to work properly with the latest Discord updates and to correctly render the `config.json` file.

The app includes a configuration for default strings that can be customized at any time through the interface.

## Main Features
SimplePresence-TF is primarily used to create a custom rich presence on Discord. It supports images, captions, timestamps, and regular text. To get started, [follow the setup guide](https://github.com/justdotJS/SimplePresence/wiki/setup).

## Future Integrations
~SimplePresence-TF plans to support integration with various services to display your current activity, such as music, videos, or movies in your Rich Presence. Planned services include:~
- ~Apple Music~
- ~FooBar2000~
- ~Google Play Music~
- ~IMDB~
- ~lastFM~
- ~Spotify~
- ~YouTube~

For now, only custom rich presence is supported. Service integrations will be added gradually.
